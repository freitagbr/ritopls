// This code implements a basic Galaga-like game. The player controls a ship, represented by
// the letter 'A'. The player can shoot lasers and must dodge asteroids. The puspose of the game
// is to destroy a large asteroid in the shape of the Riot fist bump.
//
// The player has 3 lives. Every time the ship runs into an asteroid, the player loses a life.
// However, lives are not deducted from the player until they take an action. The objective
// is to destroy every non-space character in the fist bump. Once the player has destroyed
// the fist bump, they win!
//
// The code is designed, first and foremost, to be as short as possible. The shorted version,
// without comments, clocks in at 1269 characters, though a few bytes can be shaved off here
// and there. Some general techniques are used to reduce code size:
//   - declaring variables globally
//   - using eval to construct and eliminate repeated code
//   - aliasing attributes and function names
//   - packing multiple statements into one statement using the comma operator
//   - replacing if-statements with &&-operator short-circuiting or ternary statements
//   - taking advantage of lvalues and rvalues to declare or set variables where they are used
//   - using some ES2015 constructs, like fat-arrow functions and for..of loops
//
// The game runs on modern browsers, on both desktop and mobile.

R = 1152 // the size of the board, 32 rows * 36 columns, which could be shortened by 1 byte to "O*s"
I = 1134 // the starting position of the ship, just left of the middle on the last line
O = 36   // length of a line, number of columns
T = 0    // current score
G = []   // array storing lasers currently on the board
a = []   // array storing indices of space characters of the fist bump
m = []   // array storing indices of backslash characters of the fist bump
e = []   // array storing indices of hash characters of the fist bump
s = 32   // height of board, number of rows

H = 'innerHTML' // used to access innerHTML attribute in several places, which saves several bytes
N = setTimeout  // alias setTimeout to save 8 bytes

// o calls .substring on a string with 2 arguments.
// This is used several times, so declaring it here
// save several bytes.
o = (i, b, c) => i.substring(b,c)

// This is where keystroke and touch handling is set up.
// The control scheme on a keyboard is this:
//   - Left arrow moves the ship left
//   - Right arrow moves the ship right
//   - Space shoots a laser
//
// The control scheme on a touchscreen is this:
//   - The left-third of the screen moves the ship left
//   - The right-third of the screen moves the ship right
//   - The middle-third of the screen shoots a laser
//
// In order to simplify the handling here, we need to convert keystrokes
// and touches somehow so they can be handled the same way. So, the idea is this:
//   - For a touchscreen, just take the X coordinate of the registered touch,
//     divide it by the screen width, multiply it by 3, and floor() it.
//     This gives a 0 for moving left, 1 for shooting a laser, or 2 for moving right.
//   - The keycodes for space, left arrow, and right arrow are 32, 37, and 39, respectively.
//     To convert 32 to 1, 37 to 0, and 39 to 2, the string '1----0-2' is declared.
//     Then, 32 (s) is subtracted from the key code, and that is used as an index to retrieve
//     the correct code from the string. i.e., 32 - 32 is 0, and the character at 0 is '1'.
//     Additionally, this prevents keys with the key codes 33-36 and 38 from being handled.
//
// The code is passed to V, which converts the code into the correct action to take.
onkeydown = e => V('1----0-2'[e.keyCode - s])
ontouchstart = t => V(W(t.changedTouches.item(0).screenX / screen.width * 3))

// This function takes takes a character (m) and an array of positions (a),
// and places the character at the indices in the string h. o is used for
// getting the substring of h up to the position and after the position. .map is
// used on the array to iterate over it, because it is shorter than .forEach
// or a for loop.
Y = (m, a) => {
    a.map(i => { // i is the position
        // strings are immutable in JavaScript, so the new string
        // is created from substrings of the old string
        h = o(h, 0, i) + m + o(h, i + 1, f.length)
    })
}

C = 0 // the position of the last asteroid in the array that stores asteroids

// from the player until they actually start playing the game. Lives aren't taken until
// this value is truthy. This value is set to 1 when a key is pressed.
L = 0

// In several places, a random value up to a certain size needs to be generated.
// Math.random returns a random float between 0 and 1, so multiply the random number
// by the maximum and floor it. floor also needs to be used by itself in one location.
// So, to save some bytes, use "with (Math)" so we can access these values and save them
// without having to reference them from the Math object, like "Math.floor" and "Math.random".

// In the browser, setTimeout accepts either a function or a string as its first argument.

// in a row, a 'Q' represents 1 hash character, and a 'P' represents 32 hash characters in a row. In the
// fist bump, the longest string of reoccurring characters is 27 spaces, so 32 was a nice round number to choose

// slash (/) character was chosen, because it was outside of the range of the characters that encode spaces and
// hashes, and does not need to be escaped. Also, the range starts at '1' so that '0' can be the line delimiter
// (explained above). Overall, the encoded string and decoding function are 262 characters, and the fist bump
